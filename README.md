# Blockchain-Payment-System (BPS)
Blockchain Payment System is an open source payment system
 for working with various cryptocurrencies.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- TON Gram (GRM)
- Ripple (XRP)
- TRON (TRX)

## Requirements

- Kotlin 1.3.70
- Gradle 4.10

#### TON GRAM
To work with the TON Gram cryptocurrency,
 you must run a payment system on Linux 18.04
  or build a ton-nativelib for a specific OS.
  
A docker image for build the ton-nativelib on Linux 18.04 is located at
```./src/main/resources/DockerImages.ton-nativelib-image```

## How to run
#### Ð¡onfiguring
Before starting a BPS, it is necessary
 to set cryptocurrencies and its settings in the 
 configuration file. 
 
 BPS configuration file is located at 
 ``./src/main/resources/BpsConfig.yaml``
 
 A detailed description of the parameters is in the comments of the configuration file.

#### Starting
The system is started using the Gradle command.
1. First you need to build a BPS 
```gradle build```
2. After that run it
```gradle run```

#### Testing
To run BPS unit tests, you must run command ``gradle test``

## Payments and Invoices

 entities - Payment and Invoice.

Payment - an entity is responsible for the withdrawal of cryptocurrency funds from the BPS account.
